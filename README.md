# Detecting Mental Health Signals from Social Media

## Project Overview
This project aims to use Machine Learning and NLP to detect early signs of mental health issues (suicide risk) in social media posts. The goal is to classify text as 'at risk' or 'not at risk'.

## Group Members
* Isabela Mora
* Mathieu Maury
* Yannis Michoux
* Paul Millien

## Dataset
We used publicly available datasets from Kaggle:
* Reddit Mental Health Dataset
* Suicide Watch Dataset

## Current Progress (Preliminary Results)
* **Model**: Logistic Regression (Baseline).
* **Performance**: Achieved ~94% accuracy on the test set.
* **Next Steps**: Implementing advanced models (SVM, Random Forest) and analyzing overfitting.
